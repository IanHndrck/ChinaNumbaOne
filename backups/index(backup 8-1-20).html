        <big>W</big>e are a bunch of retards who suck each other's weiners. Halt we must not, until all thy mouth-wateringly goodness of thy weiners are sucked dry.
        Suck thy weiners they might say. Then suck thy weiners we must. Our resolve is clear, If thy weiner is <i>unsucked</i>, suck it we must. A goal that is ours.
        This intelectual collective of such is lead by <b>the</b> single most handsome man that has ever existed. His true identity was never known to us sex driven troglodytes.
        This unfathomable man is only known to us as <b>THE BIG BOSS</b>. His intelect far surpasses the likes of Einstien and Tesla. But the size of his weiner was his
        most distinguishing trait. Its shear size was known to topple down mountains and split oceans in half. It was said in the <i>Niggalations 420:69</i> that he is the 2nd coming of <b>Weiner Christ</b>.
<!-- Weiner Christ lmao HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA -->

    <c2 style="position:absolute; bottom:10px; left: 40px ;text-align:justify;"><p> Greetings! My name is Ian Hendrick Pugoy, and I created this website because I wanted to do something productive during the lockdown. So, I went on my way to learn on how to create and code my own website. I also wanted to tease my friends at that time being. If you think this page looks ugly, then worry not my friend, what you said is true ;P. This webpage
    is the result of almost a week's worth of coding and learning. So feel free to explore the webpage as much as you want. More content can be viewed by using the menu button at the top-right corner of the webpage.
    If you think there can be any possible improvements to this page, then you're welcome to contact me anytime at the various social media platforms I personally use. Anyways have fun! and thanks for visiting!</p></c2>
