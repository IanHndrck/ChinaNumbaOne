              that this man not even close to being simple. The complexity of his existence and the shear size of his weiner has perplexed scientists and philosophers around the globe. But alas
              this man lives a seemingly simple life, and goes by the Alias of 'Chrystian Paul Semense Quicoy'. He has multiple girlfriends and is notably an Alpha Male of both China Numba One and the entire multiverse.  </p></a6>

   <a7><h4  style="position:absolute; LEFT:100px; BOTTOM:-270px;"><b>ANGELO "CAPT" ROMANO</b></h4></a7>
   <a15><p  style="position:absolute; BOTTOM:-90px; text-align: justify; padding-right: 50px;">The most talented man that ever existed they say. This man named Angelo Romano has survived an era from which gigantic humanoid monsters called "titans" have appeared. He was
               also the first human to ever unveil their 'zanpakuto' or 'soul slayer', and on top of that he was also the first ever human to use their 'bankai'. AND also on top of that he hosts an iq of 10 billion! For having lived during the Fire Nation's siege on the other
               nations, He ultimately led the charge towards total victory. And that is why he was bestowed the alias of 'captain'. Records suggest Capt's abuse of drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine at a young age, and now resides at the local rehabilitaion center.</p><a15>
<!-- COACH -->
   <b3><img style="position:absolute; border-style:groove; left:100px; bottom:-630px; height:250px; width:250px;" src="C:\Users\USER\Documents\ian_coding_journey\images\COACH.jpg" alt="einstien's professor"/></b3>

               with an iq directly comparable to <b>THE BIG BOSS</b> and Capt Angelo he was able to buy the entire milky way galaxy and all its residents, big or small. With a gigantic hotel built specifically for his pet ant and a massive underground bunker just for his pet cat.
               this man's wealth is just unfathomable. This man was also the main coach for Team Sector:420.69 Quasar:666 Planet:420 in the Universal Olympics hence the alias. </p></a16>

No one else but Jhon Lenard "Balong" Valdez himself. This prodigy created his own pocket dimention just to pass time and skip classes. He would disappear for a few
               weeks and magically come out of thin air if the appropriate string of words were chanted. Be weary ,these set magic words are the following, <i><b>Lenardo Online-O Naay Bago Boldo</b></i>. Be cautious in summoning this man though, the true extent of his powers are currently unkown even to modern science.
               His dried eggplant looking penis is where he gets his alias from. </p></a17>
<!-- DIO -->

   <a19><p  style="position:absolute; BOTTOM:-1770px; text-align: justify; padding-right: 50px;">This man, Prince fucking Falcon has surpassed the limits of peak homosapien capabilities, in terms of strength, inteligence, social abilities, and most importantly, weiner size.
               Strongest fuckin primate that has ever existed, yet from his astonishing physique, he is a quiet man, choosing to read yaoi instead of enforcing violence. Even as the Strongest Primate High Schooler, he chose to have us call him "Maya". Yeah that's right, a fuckin bird.</p></a19>
<!-- DISON-->

   <a20><p  style="position:absolute; BOTTOM:-2220px; text-align: justify; padding-right: 50px;">The man, My man,<b>THE ULTIMATE GAMER</b> none other than Edison "SINK" Dasok. This dude, I mean, yo fr, his skills in E-sports far surpasses any living legend and any legend that has ever existed.
               having beaten the man, Shroud himself in 1 versus 1 scenario, He is a force to be reckoned with. Even though my man here is a simp, He is whole-heartedly loyal to his queen. But for real though, kindly support this bad boi in his live streams, that would be much appreciated. This
